            <h1><b>What Is Authentication?</b></h1>
            <p>Authentication is the act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system user. In contrast with
                identification, the act of indicating a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of verifying that
                identity. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1><b>What Is Authorization?</b></h1>
            <p>Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information 
                security and computer security, and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is to define an access
                policy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1><b>What's The Difference Between Authorization & Authentication?</b></h1>
            <p>Simply put, authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas 
                authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, 
                and data a user has access to.</p>
            <br>
            <h1><b>What is Project Auth about?</b></h1>
            <p>Project Auth is about teaching everyone the difference between Authentication and 
                Authorization. And how it can be applied to real world applications.</p>
            <br>
            <h1><b>Who created Project Auth?</b></h1>

            <br>
            <h1><b>Why was Project Auth created?</b></h1>
